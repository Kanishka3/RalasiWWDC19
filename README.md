## Topic - Food Crisis and Food Waste 
There are yet the fundamentals problems in the world which are not yet able to solve. So, in this program we solve one of
in funny, practical and intuitive way. 

## Finding the Topic- Behind the scenes 
First thing, my exams were going on till 19 March. So I got less time. As soon as I came home after giving the last exam,
instead of celebrating end of the exams, I grab the laptop and started searching for the fundamental problems of the world. 
I noted some of the down and realized (the realization came from the saying of my mother) that food and water are important 
for energy. After people get food and water, then only they are able to find any chance of employment or something else. 
The point looked worthy to me. So, I continued my researched. I searched the UN Reports on it. 

Then I started making the intial scenes in Adobe XD.
